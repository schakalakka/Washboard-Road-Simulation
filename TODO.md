# TO DO list

- [x] (example) "Correct a typo in the function...."
- [x] 1.1) Deterministic wind (global) smoothing function given a maximum height threshold put all the grains above that threshold to the positions with lowest height (*Lila*)

- [x] 1.2) RANDOM wind (global) smoothing function given a maximum height threshold put all the grains above that to the  RANDOM positions. 

- [x] 3) Organize smoothing.py as in digging.py (*Dani*)

- [x] Comment functions and so (not prioritary, first the above things) 

- [ ] Debug smoothing strategy 3 (ask dani?)

- [ ] More smoothing strategies: at least have a good smoothing strategy (reasonable, realistic,....)

- [ ] 2) A generalized slope smoothing function, if we have time or we can see what was the Andrea's idea but that the code failed.

# TODO list for results / studies
- [ ] Do a procedure to, starting with a same initial road profile, do the simulation a certain number of times and then plot the AVERAGE
road profile by using the profile of all those iterations. **Dani: I have tried it but the function has to be debugged (some unexpected behaviour)**

- [ ] Do a function or similar that given a filename and a road prints a Image into a file (png, eps)

# TODO list for the REPORT
- [ ] Section 1 (see overleaf first) , (Lila)
- [ ] Section 2 (see overleaf first, and read section 3)  (Cristian)
- [x] Section 3 (model description)  (Dani)
- [ ] Section 3.1.1 jumping distance (?). hint: see paper to have idea
- [ ] Section 3.1.2 bump height determination (?) hint: see paper to clarify the 'max method"
- [x] Section 3.1.3 digging models (Dani)

**Smoothing**
- [ ] Brief introduction section 3.2
- [ ] Section 3.2.1  Diffusion efects (wind, rain ...).   (?)
- [ ] Section 3.2.2 Gravity/stability effects (?)
- [ ] Section 3.2.3 smoothing strategies (we can not do this section yet)
