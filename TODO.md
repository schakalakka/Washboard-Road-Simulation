- [x] (example) "Correct a typo in the function...."
- [ ] 1.1) Deterministic wind (global) smoothing function given a maximum height threshold put all the grains above that threshold to the positions with lowest height (*Lila*)

- [ ] 1.2) RANDOM wind (global) smoothing function given a maximum height threshold put all the grains above that to the  RANDOM positions. 

- [ ] 2) A generalized slope smoothing function (*Andreas*)

- [ ] 3) Organize smoothing.py as in digging.py (*Dani*)

- [ ] Latex Section 1 (see Overleaf), (*Cristian*)

- [ ] Comment functions and so (not prioritary, first the above things) 

- [ ] Do a procedure to, starting with a same initial road profile, do the simulation a certain number of times and then plot the AVERAGE
road profile by using the profile of all those iterations.7

- [ ] Do a function or similar that given a filename and a road prints a Image into a file (png, eps)
